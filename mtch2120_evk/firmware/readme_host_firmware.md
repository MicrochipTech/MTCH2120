# Host Firmware
Host firmware facilitates configuring the MTCH2120 device through the USB-CDC interface. Here, the ATSAMD21E18A acts as a host device. The host and the device communicate via the I2C bus. The MPLAB&#174; Data Visualizer utilizes the Touch Plugin to enable the graphical user interface (GUI) to display and configuring the user parameters of the MTCH2120 device.

The precompiled binary for the ATSAMD21E18A host is available in the [bin](../bin) directory.
